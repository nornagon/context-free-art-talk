# Context Free Art

### Jeremy Apthorp<br>[@nornagon](https://twitter.com/nornagon)[@social.coop](https://social.coop/@nornagon)

???

hi everyone, thanks for promising to listen to me for a little while!

today i want to say some things about grammar.

---

class: center, middle

## to understand
## is
## to describe

???

the need to understand the world around us is a fundamental human desire

to understand, perhaps, means to _describe the rules_ of the world

by what rules do the stars abide?

by what rules the ants and bees?

and what are the rules of language?

!['ancient' drawing on parchment of Panini operating a computer. Panini sits
cross-legged, holding a feather quill to the keyboard.](panini.jpg)

???

though i'm sure many came before him, the earliest example that i could find of
someone trying to write down the rules of language was the Hindu scholar,
Panini, who lived in northwestern India.

He wrote, using ink made from nuts and purple-leaf plums, on finely woven
cloth, four thousand statements which described in glittering detail the rules
of the Sanskrit language.

that was two and a half _thousand_ years ago, and it's the earliest known
example of anyone writing down what we would now call a _grammar_.

![photograph of noam chomsky speaking at an event in front of two
microphones](chomsky.jpg)

???

circa 1950 AD, the intellectual juggernaut noam chomsky was busy redefining the
field of linguistics from its previous state as a subjective branch of
anthropology, into its current state as a highly technical field concerned with
structure and neuroscience.

chomsky wanted to understand, not just the rules of one language, but the rules
of _language itself_. how does the human mind translate its ephemeral thoughts
into concrete utterances?

chomsky thought there was a universal language, a proto-speech based on
recursive structure, that was common to _all_ languages.

  </div>
</div>

???

around the same time, a mathematician from Pennsylvania by the name of John
Backus was getting interested in programming.

he grew up in Pottstown, PA and during high school was "apparently not a
diligent student". his rich dad paid for him to get into UVa for chemistry,
which he promptly failed out of. he joined the army and trained as a medic, but
didn't like that either and he eventually left and moved to New York.

he liked music and wanted a good hi-fi set, but apparently none of the
available ones were to his liking, so he enrolled at a radio technician's
school to learn how to make one. which, you know, i'm sure is something we can
all relate to.

  </div>
</div>

???

ALSO, i'm just saying, i've never seen John Backus and Harrison Ford in the
same room.

```bnf
Expression := Num
            | Expression Expression Op
Op         := '+' | '-' | '*' | '/'
Num        := '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4'
            | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9'
```

```
3 4 +
1 2 - 3 *
7 2 3 4 - 3 + *
```

???

anyway, one thing lead to another and Backus ended up on a committee to design
a language for specifying algorithms, called ALGOL.

in order to write down the rules of the ALGOL language, he came up with a
_meta-language_, a language for describing languages, which we still use for
all sorts of things. usually you'll see it called "BNF", short for "Backus-Naur
form", but i like the proposal of one person who wrote in to the ACM in 1967 to
call it instead "Panini-Backus Form".

Backus received the Turing award twenty years later, for his work on ALGOL and
FORTRAN, and just about every programming language today can trace part of its
history back to his work on the ALGOL committee.

---

```js
let Lisp = P.createLanguage({
  Expression: r => P.alt(r.Symbol, r.Number, r.List),

  Symbol: () =>
    P.regexp(/[a-zA-Z_-][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*/),

  Number: () =>
    P.regexp(/[0-9]+/).map(Number),

  List: r =>
    r.Expression.trim(P.optWhitespace)
      .many()
      .wrap(P.string("("), P.string(")")),

  File: r => r.Expression.trim(P.optWhitespace).many(),
});
```

<img src="parsimmon.png" alt="parsimmon logo, a persimmon between two parentheses"/>
<a href="https://github.com/jneen/parsimmon">github.com/jneen/parsimmon</a>
</div>

???

Since this _is_ a JavaScript meetup, I guess I'd better show some JavaScript.
If you ever find yourself wanting to describe a grammar in JavaScript, I can't
recommend this library, parsimmon, strongly enough.

---

???

as programmers, we're steeped in grammars, we interact with them every day.

they function as precision tools, with which we specify in exacting detail what
we want the computer to do.

???

and if we speak them even slightly wrong, out pops a compiler error.

it's a bit tyrannical, no? oh, you forgot the semicolon? what about NOW YOUR
ENTIRE PROGRAM DOESN'T WORK???

```cfdg-run
startshape start
background {b -.2}

rule start{ CHIAROSCURO{ s .4 y -.3 sat 0.5} }

rule CHIAROSCURO {
    BLACK {b .5}
}

rule BLACK 60 {
    CIRCLE {s .6}
    BLACK {x .1 r 5 s .99 b -.01 a -.01 h -1}
}
rule BLACK {
    WHITE {}
    BLACK {}
}

rule WHITE 60 {
    CIRCLE {s .6}
    WHITE {x .1 r -5 s .99 b .01 a -.01 h +1}
}
rule WHITE {
    BLACK {}
    WHITE {}
}
```
<canvas style="width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;"></canvas>

???

so i was so deliciously tickled and delighted when i discovered this whole body
of art in which people turn grammars inside-out.

we think of grammars as _checkers_, sets of rules by which we have to abide to
be understood. but what i want to show you today is a way of inverting that,
and using grammars to _generate_.

---

```bnf
Expression := Num
            | Expression Expression Op
Op         := '+' | '-' | '*' | '/'
Num        := '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4'
            | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9'
```

```js
function Expression() {
  return oneOf(
    () => Num(),
    () => `${Expression()}${Expression()}${Op()}`
  )
}
function Op() {
  return oneOf(
    '+', '-', '*', '/'
  )
}
function Num() {
  return oneOf('0', '1', '2', '3', '4',
               '5', '6', '7', '8', '9')
}
```

???

the basic idea is this: instead of thinking of each symbol in the grammar as
abstracting over or being made out of other lower-level symbols, think of it as
_creating_ those lower-level symbols.

---

class: center

<img src="lostTesla-pigeon.png" width=600 />
<img src="lostTesla-recording.png" width=600 />

???

so here's some examples of the sorts of things you can use a grammar like this
to generate. this is a twitter bot by Kate Compton, called @LostTesla. All of
these tweets are generated by a grammar.

---

class: center, middle

<img src="LostTesla - i see a pigeon.png" />

???

*point at the screen*

here's a breakdown of how it's generated. this is one example run of the
grammar.

---

<h2>Tracery <small>(by Kate Compton)</small></h2>

```js
{
  "origin": [ "#origin_regular#" ],
  "origin_regular": [
    "#adventure#",
    "#adventure#\n#adventure#"
    "#adventure#\n\n#end#",
  ],
  "adventure": [
    "#smallAdventure#",
    "#turnOnRadio#"
  ],
  "smallAdventure": [
    "#question#",
    "#weather#",
    "#inTown#",
    "#inNature#"
  ],
  // ...
}
```

???

The source code for @LostTesla is freely available (it's linked in the twitter
bio), and it's written with this really cool tool that Kate Compton made,
called tracery.

it lets you define a grammar in a JSON structure, so you can set up each of
your symbols -- origin, adventure, and so on -- as keys in the dictionary, and
then the values are all arrays of strings. in the string, you can put regular
text, but if you put a symbol name between hashes, then tracery will go and
look up that symbol in the dictionary and replace the reference with a randomly
chosen value from that symbol.

---

<h2>Tracery <small>(by Kate Compton)</small></h2>

```js
{
  "question": [
    "can i turn on the radio?",
    "who is that #person#",
    "what does #natureSound# feel like?",
    // ...
  ],
  "weather": [
    "i feel #natureSound#",
    "#natureSound#,#amFeeling# #materialAdj#",
    // ...
  ],
  "natureSound": [
    "hail",
    "rain",
    // ...
  ],
  // ...
}
```

???

i think this is beautiful, to be able to turn around this tool that we're used
to being so precise and methodical, and create with it the internal monologue
of a lonely robot who's just trying to find its way home.

if you want to know more about tracery, there's the website, and also there's
this super amazing tool called cheap bots done quick, which does all of the
boring bits of calling the twitter api for you, so you can just paste in a
tracery JSON object and get a twitter bot.

Kate Compton has written a whole lot of incredible stuff about generative art
too, and i recommend checking out her website.

---

???

but we aren't limited to just creating _text_ with grammars. everything around
you has a language to it, a rhythm, a form.

```cfdg-run

background { b -.1 sat 0.25 hue 44 }

rule ANCIENTMAP {
  ANCIENTMAP2 { s 0.05 }

    WALL1 {b 0.1 r 180 hue 34}

    WALL1{y 0.95 r -1 s 0.975 sat 0.1 b .01 hue .1}

rule WALL1 0.09 {
    SQUARE {}
    WALL1{y 0.95 r 90 s 0.975}
    WALL1{y 0.95 r -90 s 0.975}
}

rule WALL1 0.005 {
    WALL1{y 0.97 r 90 s 1.5}
    WALL1{y 0.97 r -90 s 1.5}
}
```

<canvas style="width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;"></canvas>

???

this image is generated by a grammar.

---

```cfdg
startshape ANCIENTMAP

rule ANCIENTMAP {
    WALL { brightness 0.1 hue 34 }
    WALL { brightness 0.1 hue 34 rotate 180 }
}
rule WALL {
    SQUARE {}
    WALL { y +0.95 rotate -1 scale 0.975
           sat +0.1 brightness +0.01 hue +0.1 }
}
rule WALL {
    WALL { y +0.95 rotate +1 scale 0.975 }
}
rule WALL 0.09 {
    SQUARE {}
    WALL { y +0.95 rotate +90 scale 0.975 }
    WALL { y +0.95 rotate -90 scale 0.975 }
}
rule WALL 0.005 {
    WALL { y +0.97 rotate +90 scale 1.5 }
    WALL { y +0.97 rotate -90 scale 1.5 }
}
```

???

just like when generating text, each part of the image is made up of other
smaller parts, which are in turn made of even smaller parts.

the whole thing is called "ANCIENTMAP", and then this first rule says that an
ancient map is a WALL and another WALL rotated 180°.

there are four rules for WALL, and which one is used will be chosen randomly.

the first one draws a SQUARE with the current position and color parameters,
then draws another WALL, modified by a little bit—the y will be pushed up by
0.95, we'll rotate one degree, scale a bit down, and change the color a little.

grammar. there's only one.

he has a whole jupyter notebook with awesome examples and explanations, and a

# don't read this
# it's just notes
# it's not useful

# Outline

1. What's a grammar and where did they come from?
  1. Fundamental motivation
  2. Characters
    1. Panini
    2. Chomsky
    3. Backus
  3. Grammars are a computer-sciency way of saying that big complex things are made out of other things, and those other things may themselves be made out of even smaller simpler things
  3. Backus-Naur Form
    1. So how do you write down a grammar?
    2. A simple example (arithmetic? dance moves?)
    3. This is a meta-language!
2. How to turn a grammar inside out
  1. Grammars are checkers
  2. But they're also generators!
    1. Whoa
    2. Here are some examples of people much more skilled than I doing this
      1. Tracery
        1. @LostTesla
        2. @str_voyage
        3. Explain tracery
      2. CFDG
        1. One of the Aza Raskin examples?
        2. @AwkwardPolaroid Finn Ellis
        3. Explain CFDG
      3. Ryan Herr
        1. Banjo Grammar
        2. This is awesome and I know nothing about music
3. Conclusion
  1. Understanding the world is a fudamental human need
  2. We understand the world through art
  3. One of the things I think is particularly pleasing about this kind of art
     is that it has very clear structure to it, revealed by repetition.

# Agenda

- personal story
- what's a grammar
- what's a _context-free_ grammar
  - chomsky quotes
    - there is and will always be a need to discover and overcome structures of
      hierarchy, authority and domination and constraints on freedom: slavery,
      wage-slavery, racism, sexism, authoritarian schools, etc.
  - pānini
- wait but how do you make art out of that
  - computational linguists seem confused about whether a grammar _describes_
    or _generates_ a language... and really, confused about what a "language"
    is
- obligatory javascript jokes
- examples
  - koch snowflake
  - gallery
  - https://twitter.com/AwkwardPolaroid
- in conclusion
  - you can make art out of anything
  - all acts are political
