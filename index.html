# Context Free Art

# Agenda

- personal story
- what's a grammar
- what's a _context-free_ grammar
  - chomsky quotes
    - there is and will always be a need to discover and overcome structures of
      hierarchy, authority and domination and constraints on freedom: slavery,
      wage-slavery, racism, sexism, authoritarian schools, etc.
  - pƒÅnini
- wait but how do you make art out of that
  - computational linguists seem confused about whether a grammar _describes_
    or _generates_ a language... and really, confused about what a "language"
    is
- obligatory javascript jokes
- examples
  - koch snowflake
  - gallery
  - https://twitter.com/AwkwardPolaroid
- in conclusion
  - you can make art out of anything
  - all acts are political

let me tell you bout how my life got flipped turned upside down

i thought i was learning programming

programming is FULL of rules, and in particular one kind of rule exists at the
interface between the programmer and the computer: the grammar

so i very carefully learned those rules: where to put semicolons and how to
balance parentheses, etc

i had only ever seen grammars used to CHECK something

but then a friend showed me THIS

and i was like WHAT

this tool that i thought was only for telling me when i made a mistake can also
be this incredible way of making beautiful things!

---

it is a fundamental human desire to understand the world around us

to understand, perhaps, means to _describe the rules_ of the world

by what rules do the stars abide?

by what rules the ants and bees?

and what are the rules of language?

though i'm sure many came before him, the earliest instance i found of someone
trying to write down the rules of language was the Hindu scholar, Panini, who
lived two and a half _thousand_ years ago in northwestern India. He wrote,
using ink made from nuts and purple-leaf plums, on finely woven cloth, four
thousand rules which described in glittering detail the rules of the Sanskrit
language.

~then 2400 years passed~

# what's a grammar

---

# what's a grammar

- it's a description of a _language_
- _sentences_ in a language are sequences of symbols
- a _grammar_ is a description of which sentences are allowed in the language
  and which aren't

---

# what's a grammar
- the first known complete description of a language was written by Hindi
  scholar ‡§™‡§æ‡§£‡§ø‡§®‡§ø ([Panini][panini-wiki]), around 2,200 years ago.

cross-legged, holding a feather quill to the keyboard.](panini.jpg)

# what's a grammar

so ok, how do we describe which sentences are allowed and which aren't?

let's pretend we're studying a language where the symbols are `i` and `e` and
`c`.

and not just any combination of `i`s, `e`s and `c`s are allowed, there are
RULES dangit

everyone knows i comes before e, except after c.

so `ie` is obviously a valid sentence.
so is `cei`.
`cie` is NOT OK

IEs := IE | IE IEs
S := IEs | IEs C EIs | C EIs

```
Sentence is Noun Verb
         or Noun Verb, then Sentence
         or Noun Verb (but Sentence)
```


```
S -> a b
S -> b a
S -> S S
```

```
ab ‚úÖ
bb üôÖ
abba ‚úÖ
acdc üôÖ
```

# what's a _context-free_ grammar

a contextful grammar would be one where the "matching" part of a rule depended
on context.

---

# what's a grammar

- you can use a grammar to check whether a particular sentence is
  grammatical...
- ...or you could flip off the prescriptivists and use it to make art instead
