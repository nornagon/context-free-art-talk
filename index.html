# Outline

1. What's a grammar and where did they come from?
  1. Fundamental motivation
  2. Characters
    1. Panini
    2. Chomsky
    3. Backus
  3. Backus-Naur Form
    1. So how do you write down a grammar?
    2. A simple example (arithmetic? dance moves?)
    3. This is a meta-language!
2. How to turn a grammar inside out
  1. Grammars are checkers
  2. But they're also generators!
    1. Whoa
    2. Here are some examples of people much more skilled than I doing this
      1. Tracery
        1. @LostTesla
        2. @str_voyage
        3. Explain tracery
      2. CFDG
        1. One of the Aza Raskin examples?
        2. @AwkwardPolaroid Finn Ellis
        3. Explain CFDG
      3. Ryan Herr
        1. Banjo Grammar
        2. This is awesome and I know nothing about music
3. Conclusion
  1. Understanding the world is a fudamental human need
  2. We understand the world through art
  3. One of the things I think is particularly pleasing about this kind of art
     is that it has very clear structure to it, revealed by repetition.

# Agenda

- personal story
- what's a grammar
- what's a _context-free_ grammar
  - chomsky quotes
    - there is and will always be a need to discover and overcome structures of
      hierarchy, authority and domination and constraints on freedom: slavery,
      wage-slavery, racism, sexism, authoritarian schools, etc.
  - pƒÅnini
- wait but how do you make art out of that
  - computational linguists seem confused about whether a grammar _describes_
    or _generates_ a language... and really, confused about what a "language"
    is
- obligatory javascript jokes
- examples
  - koch snowflake
  - gallery
  - https://twitter.com/AwkwardPolaroid
- in conclusion
  - you can make art out of anything
  - all acts are political

  can i make a cfdg that shows "undefined is not a function"..?

it is a fundamental human desire to understand the world around us

to understand, perhaps, means to _describe the rules_ of the world

by what rules do the stars abide?

by what rules the ants and bees?

and what are the rules of language?

though i'm sure many came before him, the earliest instance i found of someone
trying to write down the rules of language was the Hindu scholar, Panini, who
lived in northwestern India. He wrote,
using ink made from nuts and purple-leaf plums, on finely woven cloth, four
thousand statements which described in glittering detail the rules of the Sanskrit
language.

that was two and a half _thousand_ years ago.

circa 1950 AD, the intellectual juggernaut noam chomsky was busy redefining the
field of linguistics from its previous state as a subjective branch of
anthropology, into its current state as a highly technical field concerned with
structure and neuroscience. chomsky wanted to understand, not just the rules of
one language, but the rules of _language itself_. how does the human mind
translate its ephemeral thoughts into concrete utterances?  chomsky thought
there was a universal language, a proto-speech based on recursive structure,
that was common to _all_ languages.

around the same time, a mathematician from Pennsylvania by the name of John
Backus was getting interested in programming. he grew up in Pottstown, PA and
during high school was "apparently not a diligent student". his rich dad paid
for him to get into UVa for chemistry, which he promptly failed out of. he
joined the army and trained as a medic, but didn't like that either and he
eventually left and moved to New York. he liked music and wanted a good hi-fi
set, but apparently none of the available ones were to his liking so he
enrolled at a radio technician's school to learn how to make one, which, you
know, i'm sure is something we can all relate to.

anyway, one thing lead to another and Backus ended up on a committee to design
a language for specifying algorithms, called ALGOL.

[... lead the way to context-free grammars being the main way that programming
langs are designed]

as programmers, we're steeped in grammars, we interact with them every day.
they function as precision tools, with which we specify in exacting detail what
we want the computer to do. and if we speak them even slightly wrong, out pops
a compiler error. it's a bit tyrannical, no? oh, you forgot the semicolon? what
about NOW YOUR ENTIRE PROGRAM DOESN'T WORK???

so i was so deliciously tickled and delighted when i discovered this whole body
of art in which people turn grammars inside-out.

we think of grammars as _checkers_, sets of rules by which we have to abide to
be understood. but what i want to show you today is a way of inverting that,
and using grammars to _generate_. to generate images, text, even music.

the basic idea is this: instead of thinking of each symbol in the grammar as
abstracting over other lower-level symbols, think of it as _generating_ those
lower-level symbols. so for example, in JavaScript, a variable declaration
might look like

VariableDeclaration := ConstOrLet Identifier
                    or ConstOrLet Identifier Equals Expression
ConstOrLet := const
           or let
Identifier := (any sequence of non-space, non-punctuation characters)
Equals     := '='
Expression := [...]

so you could look at this and say, oh, okay, a variable declaration must start
with a const or a let, then an identifier of some kind, then maybe an equals
followed by an expression.

the first example of generative grammars i want to give is of a grammar which
generates text.

# what's a grammar

- it's a description of a _language_
- _sentences_ in a language are sequences of symbols
- a _grammar_ is a description of which sentences are allowed in the language
  and which aren't

---

# what's a grammar
- the first known complete description of a language was written by Hindi
  scholar ‡§™‡§æ‡§£‡§ø‡§®‡§ø ([Panini][panini-wiki]), around 2,200 years ago.

!['ancient' drawing on parchment of Panini operating a computer. Panini sits
cross-legged, holding a feather quill to the keyboard.](panini.jpg)

# what's a grammar

so ok, how do we describe which sentences are allowed and which aren't?

let's pretend we're studying a language where the symbols are `i` and `e` and
`c`.

and not just any combination of `i`s, `e`s and `c`s are allowed, there are
RULES dangit

everyone knows i comes before e, except after c.

so `ie` is obviously a valid sentence.
so is `cei`.
`cie` is NOT OK

IEs := IE | IE IEs
S := IEs | IEs C EIs | C EIs

```
Sentence is Noun Verb
         or Noun Verb, then Sentence
         or Noun Verb (but Sentence)
```


```
S -> a b
S -> b a
S -> S S
```

```
ab ‚úÖ
bb üôÖ
abba ‚úÖ
acdc üôÖ
```

# what's a _context-free_ grammar

a contextful grammar would be one where the "matching" part of a rule depended
on context.

---

# what's a grammar

- you can use a grammar to check whether a particular sentence is
  grammatical...
- ...or you could flip off the prescriptivists and use it to make art instead
